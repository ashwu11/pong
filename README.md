# Pong
### A classic remake of the retro pong game
This game was configured and developed using C++, CMake, and the raylib library. 
The retro-style graphics were designed using raylib and this project implements a collision 
detection system that ensures a smooth and realistic gaming experience.
To ensure competitive gameplay, the ball accelerates as the point progresses, until it is missed by a player.
Players are able to pause and resume a game while keeping their respective scores, allowing 
them to take a break or strategize during matches.
There are two game modes available: 
- Single player VS CPU
- Two Players

### Player Controls
| Player  |  Up  | Down |
|---------|------|------|
|Player 1 | ↑    | ↓    |
|Player 2 | A    | Z    |
